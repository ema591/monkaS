<p>An Reflection: <br>
Overall the group assignment went well. The work was split into equal parts so that everyone in the group can have an equal contribution towards the assignment due date and removes any disagreements of the allocated work load. Our group was eager in completing the assignment in time to avoid any hardships or disagreements in preparing for the assignment. Our group consisted of members with a range of skills such as coding for the website and presentation skills in presenting the website assignment. We utilised facebook messenger groups, github and google drive, this meant that we can share our work together and fix any errors if necessary. Messenger was an effective method of communication because it allowed for any group meetup arrangements to be made and notifies each member of incoming messages or queries regarding the assignment. One thing that could have been improved on was our work deadline management skills. I found that our project was surprising as it was unique and interesting. I’ve learnt that working as a team is effective in completing these kinds of assignments.

As a group I believed we worked well together everyone was well organised and on time we
all spilt the work fairly and only took on what we could handle everyone finished their work
on time as a group all our differences work well together offering a range of skills and
interests that lead us to an interesting project idea. This has been one of the best group’s
I’ve worked with and has been super easy to get along with as well as splitting the work up
evenly. If I was to say there was one thing to improve on I would say communication might
be a weaker part of the group but over all we have gotten through it and its been working
for the group I learnt a lot working with the group especially when it came to our project
	idea I learnt a bit about science and how the body builds up a tolerance of different allergies.</p>

The group has really worked hard on assignment 3, after facing the lower marks in assignment 2 we
were disappointed, but the group has used it as a motivation to do better in assignment 3 and they
showed it that we can do better. There was nothing this time which would have disappointed me that
group members are not replying to the texts or ignoring the texts. Everyone was helping each other
and understanding others point of view. Emma has explained me things as many times as I have asked
her and even did some search from my end when I told her that I am bad at research. Things which I
would say would have been better would be working and understanding things in much clearer way in
tutorial rather than on social media but either ways it just depends on how we consider ourselves that
we can work better. The thing I have learned working with this group is that you need to cheer up
your teammate when they are losing hope in something and look for the way how you can be able to
help them. The shocking part was that how group lost marks because of me when I was failed to
complete the sparkplus part, but no one complained about it, and neither they talked about it again.
Working in group can be hard but as long as you are trying to do the work everyone will appreciate
	your effort.</p>

Assignment 3 went very well. Emma assigned every teammate with proper work. With Emma’s father’s professional help and everyone’s effort, we made a physical prototype to stimulate implant device’s structure. Microbits are applied to program the physical model which demonstrates the process of releasing medication at certain pace. To make a decent presentation, we reached an agreement that mock-up app is the best choice to illustrate how user will control this device.  After some paper prototyping, we chose to use Invision to make a low-fidelity prototype. The whole process went not that well as I expected because this app is mainly for developing interactive mock-upapp and Invison studio crushed many times on my computer. All in all, with all teammates’ work, I believe we made a very satisfying job. </p>

Emma Reflection:<br>
Our assignment went ok. The website was already set up so template was available and easy to adjust for the first part of the assignment. Group members completed most of their work but did not know what they had to do sometimes. I had to find links for people to research as they could not find them (?). Communication between members was minimal and over Facebook. We are not very pro-active and also struggle to work around multiple assignments due at the same time. Members could inmprove on being more proactive, putting the time in to research and voicing their uncertainties when not sure what is expected of them. Website design, personally I am not happy with my website template I used and wouldn’t mind making it nicer. I expected around more than this level of work to be done but the assignment was completed at the very least. Majority of work was written by me as was the making of the physical prototype. Working in groups requires lots of communication needed and it needs to be active communication which we stopped doing towards the end. I learnt that I need to hold their hands for a lot of the tasks in the assignment despite the requirements being written there clearly.</p>

<p>
Summary<br>
As a group I think we were mostly happy with how we worked together and contributed to the assignment. We all have different university subjects that we are also completing other assignments and tasks on so it was a juggle for everyone to find time to complete this assignment. It was very beneficial to have sorted out in the tutorial class who was responsible for what but it was not followed through properly without much nagging. Members need to make sure they know what their part of the assignment is. Each members interest in IT varied and help in the written pieces but ctheir attitute could be more proactive. Group members provided feedback and communicated with each other well enough and everyone completed their section of the assignment before the due date but cut it very close. The group as a whole worked quite well together splitting up the work between all the group
members everyone is able to do there part and if there is any issues they ask the group something
what we all learned from working in a group is that in some cases is it can quite difficult but if there
is good communication and team work that helps a lot we could have improved a bit on some of our
communication our group as a whole as worked well together there hasn’t been any arguments or
disagreements and all the team has contributed there part this has been a extremely easy to work
with group and has made getting through these assignments a breeze everyone’s interests in the
field of IT was beneficial it kept everyone motivated and interested in the group and the project
ideas working as a group took a lot of stress out of the assignment because the whole group could
work on the one assignment it make the whole process smooth and easy splitting it up Ethernet us
allow each group member to work to there strengths and make each part more manageable over all
we worked well as a group and were able to finish everything on time. </p>
