<p>An Reflection: <br>
Overall the group assignment went well. The work was split into equal parts so that everyone in the group can have an equal contribution towards the assignment due date and removes any disagreements of the allocated work load. Our group was eager in completing the assignment in time to avoid any hardships or disagreements in preparing for the assignment. Our group consisted of members with a range of skills such as coding for the website and presentation skills in presenting the website assignment. We utilised facebook messenger groups, github and google drive, this meant that we can share our work together and fix any errors if necessary. Messenger was an effective method of communication because it allowed for any group meetup arrangements to be made and notifies each member of incoming messages or queries regarding the assignment. One thing that could have been improved on was our work deadline management skills. I found that our project was surprising as it was unique and interesting. I’ve learnt that working as a team is effective in completing these kinds of assignments.

As a group I believed we worked well together everyone was well organised and on time we all split the work fairly and only took what we could handle everyone finished their work on time as a group all our differences work well together offering a range of skills and interests that lead us to an interesting project idea. This has been one of the best groups I’ve worked with and has been super easy to get along with as well as splitting the work up evenly. If I was to say there was one thing to improve on I would say communication might be a weaker part of the group but over all we have gotten through it and it's been working for the group I learnt a lot working with the group, especially when it came to our project idea I learnt a bit about science and how the body builds up a tolerance of different allergies</p>

The group has done a great job. I really liked how we were able to communicate and help each other even out of the class. Everyone finished their work on time. I was helped by the group members at every point possible. Emma was good with her scientific ideas for the project helped us all to learn about science. The group really worked as the team to help everyone. I had to miss one tutorial because of a doctor’s appointment and that tutorial was important because we had to do the planning on who is going to cover which part but group really helped me and divided the work fairly and also told me which parts I need to complete. I hope we will work the same way or better than this in assignment 3. There was one thing I would like to point out which was lacking in our group was communication, the communication was good but could have been better. Otherwise I think I have learnt a lot from all the members of group.</p>

The whole process went very well. On the tutorial, we discussed about the assignment in detail and assigned each teammate adequate amount of work. Thanks to the help of Google doc, we can edit documents together and see each other’s work. What is surprising is that project idea of Emma’s, along with professional insight and personal experience, she worked out a brilliant idea about developing a anti-allergy device to help improve the quality of life of people who suffer from allergies. After discussing, our team thinks we can make a simple prototype depending on mock-up app online which is also a part of assignment three. One thing I learnt from this great group is that teamwork really has a positive influence on me not only helping me with coming up new views on finishing my IT technology article but also guiding me to do my part of assignment. I think one thing that needs to be improved is that if I could know the field better so that I can write about blockchain more deeply. </p>

Emma Reflection:<br>
Our assignment went ok. The website was already set up so template was available and easy to adjust for the first part of the assignment. Group members completed most of their work but did not know what they had to do sometimes. I had to find links for people to research as they could not find them (?). Communication between members was minimal and over Facebook. We are not very pro-active and also struggle to work around multiple assignments due at the same time. Members could inmprove on being more proactive, putting the time in to research and voicing their uncertainties when not sure what is expected of them. Website design, personally I am not happy with my website template I used and wouldn’t mind making it nicer. I expected around more than this level of work to be done but the assignment was completed at the very least. Majority of work was written by me as was the making of the physical prototype. Working in groups requires lots of communication needed and it needs to be active communication which we stopped doing towards the end. I learnt that I need to hold their hands for a lot of the tasks in the assignment despite the requirements being written there clearly.</p>

<p>
Summary<br>
As a group I think we were mostly happy with how we worked together and contributed to the assignment. We all have different university subjects that we are also completing other assignments and tasks on so it was a juggle for everyone to find time to complete this assignment. It was very beneficial to have sorted out in the tutorial class who was responsible for what but it was not followed through properly without much nagging. Members need to make sure they know what their part of the assignment is. Each members interest in IT varied and help in the written pieces but ctheir attitute could be more proactive. Group members provided feedback and communicated with each other well enough and everyone completed their section of the assignment before the due date but cut it very close. </p>
