">Australian born Chinese, can speak English, Shanghainese and Mandarin.

							</p>
							<p style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; "> My ideal job was in Cyber Security, perhaps starting as a Penetration tester which requires lower qualifications of a bachelor or diploma to enter and one can work up towards cyber security analyst from there. However, I am enjoying the current intro course in UCD so maybe a job in UX would be interesting too, although I don’t know if that would involve a lot of stats or not.

To step in this field, it is better for me to gain an entry level position like a statistical assistant. To be qualified, I still need to achieve my bachelor’s degree first and have some internship to gain data analyst experience.

 </p>
<p style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; "> Career plans: The career plans for our group are still same. Emma and Umer wants to carry on with cyber security, Jordan wants to become software developer, Joe is still interested to become data analyst and An’s dream is to become a Web developer. Even after the feedback from assignments 1 & 2 career are plans are still same as they were. The common elements include that we should know programming languages and have experience in relative fields. The demands and role in each field differentiates it from the other field. Emma’s and Umer’s fields are same as they both wants to become cyber security analyst. Jordan’s and An’s career plan are similar but different as Jordan wants to become software developer and An wants to become web developer. Software developer develops software and web developer is software engineer who only builds web applications. Joe’s career plan is completely different to all as he wants to become the data analyst.
. Our job interests vary from data analysis to game developer to cyber security analyst etc. The skills and qualifications for these jobs are also varied. Common to all these jobs would be the ability to work with others and knowledge of how IT systems function either in coding or hardware level. All these jobs also require come level of certification or degree to enter and most require prior years of experience.
